##Installation:

In affinity go to Window -> Library, then in the Library tap use the drop down in the top right to install the macro file.

##Troubleshooting:

If channels are out of order or potentially blank, chances are you ran the macro with existing Spare Channels. Check the channels tab, and delete any channels with a trashcan delete icon first, then try again.
