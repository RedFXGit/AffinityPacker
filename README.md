## Installation:

In affinity go to Window -> Library, then in the Library tap use the drop down in the top right to install the macro file.

## Usage:

Make sure your desired channel content are in groups titled R, G, B and/or A, appropriately. RGB are **all** required for RGB packing, but leaving a group empty or with a blank layer should be fine. 
The most effecient way to use this macro is probably to set this formatting up in a template document you can open, use Place to *link* elements from their own documents into each group, then save as. This way you can live-edit each element and simply flip back to this document to re-export.
Just click the macro of your choosing (currently either RGB or RGBA) to run.

## Troubleshooting:

If channels are out of order or potentially blank, chances are you ran the macro with existing Spare Channels. Check the channels tab, and delete any channels with a trashcan delete icon first, then try again.
